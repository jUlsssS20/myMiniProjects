# Project-Rock-Paper-Scissors-

This is a mini-project that runs through prompts. It uses JavaScript to define the game's logic.

It is basically rock paper scissors, hence the name. It generates a choice from the computer using Math.random while getting the user's choice using a prompt. Each game is a best of 5 (first to 3). After each game ends, it just prompts to a new one. It uses mostly functions as this is supposed to be a project for Odin. I used a little bit of while loops to simplify the round logic.
